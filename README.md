# standup-weather
As part of our daily standup meeting I usually end up providing a brief weather report. People haven't gotten tired of it yet, so it looks like I'm in it for the long haul. Up to now I've been using a random screen-grab from the Weather Network, but if I'm going to be doing this I'm going to do this right! This project creates a simple weather portal in the style that a local weatherman would use and allows for easy export to be used as a background image in Teams chat. 

Levity aside, it's also practice on working with Angular and web technoligies in general since there's been a push to create portals and other tools using Angular at work. 

## Key Features
1. Pull local live weather reports + forecasts and populate fields accordingly.
2. Select a key image to use as the central background based on the weather (i.e. the main thing the weather guy's pointing at.)
3. Button to easily export the page as an image formatted for use in Teams chat. 

## Someday / Maybe Features
1. Create a Java based backend to properly handle API keys (don't really care about a free public weather API key to start, but this should be done properly.)
