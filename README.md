# standup-weather
As part of our daily standup meeting I usually end up providing a brief weather report. People haven't gotten tired of it yet, so it looks like I'm in it for the long haul. Up to now I've been using a random screen-grab from the Weather Network, but if I'm going to be doing this I'm going to do this right! This project creates a simple weather portal in the style that a local weatherman would use and allows for easy export to be used as a background image in Teams chat. 

Levity aside, it's also practice on working with Angular and web technoligies in general since there's been a push to create portals and other tools using Angular at work. 

## Key Features
1. Pull local live weather reports + forecasts and populate fields accordingly.
2. Select a key image to use as the central background based on the weather (i.e. the main thing the weather guy's pointing at.)
3. Button to easily export the page as an image formatted for use in Teams chat. 

## Someday / Maybe Features
1. Create a Java based backend to properly handle API keys (don't really care about a free public weather API key to start, but this should be done properly.)

# StandupWeather

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.0.4.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
